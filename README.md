# Vector Database Practice Using FAISS and CHROMADB

This repository contains a practice project focused on implementing and experimenting with vector databases using FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) and CHROMADB. The goal is to explore efficient similarity search and retrieval of high-dimensional data, commonly used in machine learning and AI applications.


## Introduction
Vector databases are essential for managing and querying high-dimensional vector data. This project demonstrates how to:
- Index and search vectors using FAISS.
- Manage and query vector embeddings with CHROMADB.
- Perform similarity searches for tasks like recommendation systems, image retrieval, and natural language processing.

## Technologies Used
- **FAISS**: A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
- **CHROMADB**: A lightweight and fast vector database for managing embeddings.
- **Python**: The programming language used for implementation.


## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Abubakar0011/Vector_DB_Pract.git
    cd Vector_DB_Pract
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Example**:
    Execute the example script to see how vector databases work:
    ```bash
    python example.py
    ```

## Usage

This project includes several examples demonstrating how to use FAISS and CHROMADB for various tasks. Check the `examples` directory for more details.
